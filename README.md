# Dispatcher Dimmadome

## Introduction

> A Custom Discord Bot that used the AnIdiotsGuide Guidebot  Class Version. It is capable of transmitting using the Nexus Gridnet Radio Network, some Meme/Funny Functions, and other Utility Features. It is partially capable of multiple "clients", aka multiple servers can use it, but only one radio network is supported for now


## Your on your own for now. 
 Figure it out. 
 
 All Zones are hard coded into the Transmit commands and other stuff, ideally, this would be put into a database, or pulled from Gridnet regularly and it would automatically make the channels available for transmitting. 
 


## Roadmap

* Upon adding the bot to a server, have it store a array of IDs for the Zones and Channels and their names. This allows for in the future, having the transmit command convert the given channel into the routing needed. 
* After above, rewrite transmit command. 
* Fix Utility Commands for Gridnet. 
* Work on General Scalability

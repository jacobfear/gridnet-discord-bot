# Dispatcher Dimmadome

## Introduction

> A Custom Discord Bot that used the AnIdiotsGuide Guidebot  Class Version. It is capable of transmitting using the Nexus Gridnet Radio Network, some Meme/Funny Functions, and other Utility Features. It is partially capable of multiple "clients", aka multiple servers can use it, but only one radio network is supported for now

## Code Samples



## Installation
 Figure it out. 
 
 All Zones are hard coded into the Transmit commands and other stuff, ideally, this would be put into a database, or pulled from Gridnet regularly and it would automatically make the channels available for transmitting.
